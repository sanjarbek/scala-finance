SCALA is a fairly new JVM language which has many advantages.

SCALA has a scripting-like usage and syntax much like ruby.Although, SCALA is strongly typed.

Very importantly SCALA has an ACTOR model for concurrency that is like Erlang. This makes parallel programing fluid and painless.

Also, SCALA is a new mixture of Functional and OO programing.

SCALA Finance will use all these features to create a new breed of functional financial POSO's(Plain Old SCALA Objects) that can be used in the LIFT framework or the new Typesafe stack.

> Typesafe has the added benefit of having Martin Odersky as a founder. Odersky also happens to be the creator of SCALA.

SCALA Finance seeks to be a repository of POSO's that can be used together in different mosaics to create a varied array of Financial functions for the professional , academic and open-source developer.

The SCALA Finance's MPL 1.1(Mozilla Public license 1.1) allows the developer to use any or all of the SCALA Finance code within a larger proprietary project.

In the spirit of Open Source , members should contribute to SCALA Finance in some way , if they have expectations to receive something from the project.
